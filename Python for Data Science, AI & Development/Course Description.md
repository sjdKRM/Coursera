IBM Data Science - Python for Data Science, AI & Development course provided a comprehensive introduction to Python, focusing on key aspects of data science, including:

Basic Python Programming: Learning the fundamentals of Python, such as variables, data types, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming.
Data Science Libraries: Working with popular Python libraries like Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation, and using Beautiful Soup for web scraping and data collection via APIs.
Practical Applications: Demonstrating the ability to perform tasks such as data analysis, visualization, and automation through hands-on projects using Jupyter Notebooks.
Web Scraping and APIs: Collecting data from online sources using Python, APIs, and libraries like Beautiful Soup to scrape and manipulate real-world data.
These projects reflect my growing proficiency in Python and my ability to apply this knowledge to solve data science challenges. The skills I have developed include Python programming, data analysis, data visualization, and web scrapingâ€”all of which are vital for roles in data science, data analysis, software development, and AI.
